# Small-Fan-Array-Wind-Tunnel-FAWT-Team-5
This contains the python code used to control our FAWT, as well as the instructions for how to use the code and FAWT properly.


# Requirements
This code will only work with the FAWT Team 5 constructed. We recommend using Thonny to run the code, as it is easy to use. Python 3.13.3 is also required, as this code uses Tkinter (Python's built in GUI).
